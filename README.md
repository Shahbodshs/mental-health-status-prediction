Hello again, its me with another kaggle playground series. 
In this project we aim to predict hte mental state of a patient, considering his/her life situations. 
The link for the kaggle playground(competitions) is provided [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11).

I aimed to use CatBoost for model training, and i reached a good accuracy, but maybe in the future i will check on it later and try to implement a better model, i will give the updates here if so.

Any questions? Contact [me.])(Shahbods26@gmail.com).
